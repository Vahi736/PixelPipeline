This growth is driven by the increasing prevalence of iron deficiency anemia across the global population, particularly among pregnant women, children, and elderly individuals. As iron deficiency remains one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide, the demand for injectable iron supplements is expected to rise steadily. Additionally, the shift toward more effective and rapid treatment methods in anemia management, as well as rising healthcare awareness, contributes to the market's expansion.In addition to the growing prevalence of anemia, the market is also fueled by advancements in injectable iron formulations, which offer better efficacy and fewer side effects compared to traditional oral iron supplements. As healthcare infrastructure improves in emerging markets, accessibility to injectable treatments is expected to rise, further propelling market growth. The increasing adoption of intravenous iron therapies in clinical settings, combined with the rise of home healthcare options, is expected to drive demand for iron deficiency injectables in the coming years.
